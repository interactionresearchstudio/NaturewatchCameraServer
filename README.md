# AMAZING NATUREWATCH CAMERA SERVER

This is a Python server script that captures a video stream from a Pi Camera and serves it as a .mjpg through a control website to another device. Part of the My Naturewatch project in collaboration with the RCA.


## Enable SSH (to be automated) 

Add a blank file named `ssh` to the boot folder on the SD card

## Set up OTG ethernet (to be automated) 

Follow the guide created by gbaman to set up OTG ethernet over USB serial https://gist.github.com/gbaman/975e2db164b3ca2b51ae11e45e8fd40a

## Requirements

- Docker installed on Raspbian Stretch
https://gist.github.com/mikevanis/e360f45e394674b59d663fdf0470d42f

## Running the server

Build the docker container
	
	docker-compose build
	
## Configuring the wifi setup

Run the config setup python script. This will reboot the pi
	
	sudo python3 NaturewatchCameraServer/cfgsetup.py

## Access the interface
    
The website is then accessible through its hostname:

	http://raspberrypi.local/
	
Be sure to replace `raspberrypi.local` with whatever hostname the Pi has.

## Running tests

You can run tests directly on the Raspberry pi to test the various functions of the
software as well as the API. After building the container, run the tests with pytest.

    docker run \
    --device /dev/vcsm --device /dev/vchiq \
    -p 5000:5000 \
    -v ~/data:/naturewatch_camera_server/static/data \
    naturewatchcameraserver \
    pytest -v naturewatch_camera_server/
