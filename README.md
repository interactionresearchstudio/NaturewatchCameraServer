# NaturewatchCameraServer

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that this repository is archived. We have decided to leave the
> original software for the My Naturewatch Camera intact here. If you would like
> an easy plug-and-play experience, please use this version as it aligns with the
> instructions on the main website. If you'd like to play around with the software,
> develop new features, or use specific combinations of Pis and cameras, head over

This is the main software for the My Naturewatch Camera. It is a Python server 
script that captures a video stream from a Pi Camera and serves it as a .mjpg 
through a control website to another device. The website can be used to start 
a photo capture or video capture based on motion detected in the frame. The 
software is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi Zero W so that you can make your 
own low-cost wildlife camera.

Part of the My Naturewatch project by the Interaction Research Studio, in collaboration with the RCA.

# How to install

To use the image, download the lastest zip build from [Releases](https://github.com/interactionresearchstudio/NaturewatchCameraServer/releases)

Uncompress and burn this to an SD card. We recommend using [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) for this.

## Configuring the wifi setup

The device automatically creates a hotspot network named MyNatureWatch-12345, with the numbers being a unique ID. 

You can also connect the device directly to a home network by following this [guide](https://mynaturewatch.net/instructions-homenetwork)

## Access the interface

The website is then accessible through its IP address:

	http://192.168.50.1
	
If your device has Bonjour installed, you can also use:

	http://mynaturewatchcamera.local/
